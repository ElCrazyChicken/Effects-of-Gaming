			<h1>History of Video Games</h1>
			
			<p>The first couple of video games were created on huge mainframe machines.  There were no global intentions of such creation.  However, as programmers and engineers experimented with technology at the time, some of these individuals ended up designing actual games on them.  By the 1970's, there was a realization that these attractions could be sold to the public.  At this point, video games enter the market.  </p>

			<p>Many business owners saw the potential of a booming business in video games, and quickly built companies around making and distributing video games.  However, video games were, and still are today, an infant to the world.  Many companies failed and some thrived to become billion dollar industries. </p>
			
			<br>
			
			<p>Today, video games continue to evolve and so the rest of technology.  Humanity must understand the effects that video games will bring along.</p>

			<h1>Future of Games</h1>
			
			<p>Video game developers continue to aim for creating addictive fun games.  But one major effect from this is the creation of educational games and realistic games.  It has only been a few generations from the very first video game but we already have reached a point where we are aiming towards virtual reality.</p>

			<br>
			
			<p>Virtual reality is not the only path humans  are taking.  As mentioned before, more resources are being used towards making educational games along with simulations.  There are many other paths also being taken and many will thrive, while some may not.</p>
			
			<br>
			
			<p>It is very exciting to see what awaits us in the next 10 years.  How do you predict that video games will affect our society in the future?  Are you excited or nervous?</p>

			<p2>Super Mario Bros. realeased in the 1980's.  Not too long later we have realistic looking games.  Although it may be pricey to have the modern gaming setup, in the future, prices will decrease and everyone will be able to run realistic looking games on their phones.</p2>

			<h1>The Debate</h1>
			
			<p><b>How are we going to let video games affect our lives?</b>  Not everyone plays video games.  Video games are everywhere now and some people argue that they are bad while others object.  We must also keep in mind the video game businesses.  It is their goal to make profit making and distributing video games. In the end, I believe consumers are in most control to the direction where we head with video games.
