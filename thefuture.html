		<h1>The Future (Continued)</h1>
			
			<h2>My thoughts about it</h2>
			
			<p>I have exciting mixed feelings about the future of our video games.</p>
			
			<br>
			
			<p>Video games are meant to bring something to the player: emotion, entertainment, relationship, knowledge, etc.  However, the video game business is quite a scary machine.  Business owners are focused on the profit side of video games and we as consumers are stuck as test subjects because ethics within the gaming industry has yet to be established.  Many gaming companies are researching how to get the most money from players in the form of gambling, dlc, game-cosmetics, and so on.  The question here is how will consumers and business decision-makers shape our future?</p>
			
			<p>Technology advances every day and we are a couple of steps away from artificial intelligence.  Everyone should be aware that once artificial intelligence becomes self-aware and self-thought, it will have a place inside our beloved games.  Graphics continue to develop to the point where it's difficult to distinguish from graphics and real-life.  Games like grand theft auto will be a hot topic about realism and ethics on the game's design.  And our fascination with exploration inside video games might lead us to develop games that simulate space exploration and engineering.</p>
			
			<p> Today, the whole video game industry has grown to be as big as professional sports.  There's some talk about a crash in the industry. I personally feel that if there were a crash, it wouldn't last too long.  We're at a point where we know, from past experiences, how to recover and build again.  My theory will be that once robots and AI take over many of our jobs, humans will have to adapt and learn new skills.  If the path is set right, in the scenario where everything becomes cheaper and most people have livable income, more peope will spend more time and more money playing a video game of their liking.</p>
			
			<p>A hundred years ago, there were no airplanes.  A little before that no cars.  Now we can explore space.  Exactly 41 years ago, the first video game was released.  Now, you can become an actual pilot by playing flight simulator.</p>
			<br>
			
			<h2>My Goals in the Future</h2>
			<p> My goal in the future is to create a game that will educate people in certain areas of skills that are going to be of <b>high demand</b>.  I want to create a game that doesn't focus on getting real money from the player.  This game is going to take me a couple of years to make but eventually, and hopefully, I can make something that will have an impact to someone's life. A lot can change in a couple of years but one thing is certain, we are already steps into the era of information, technology, and security.  This game will be affordable to everyone and will have no element of gambling or pay-to-win.  The number 1 goal is to making an educational game that absorbs players into the game.  But I'll definitely be making other games as I learn to make them.</p>
